Clam Chowder
====================

Ingredients
-----------
 * 3 (6.5 ounce) cans minced clams
 * 6 strips of bacon
 * 1 cup minced onion
 * 1 cup diced celery
 * 2 cups cubed potatoes
 * 1 cup diced carrots
 * 3/4 cup butter
 * 3/4 cup all-purpose flour
 * 1 quart half-and-half cream
 * 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
 * 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
 * ground black pepper to taste

Instructions
-------------
 #. Cook the bacon until crisp, remove from the skillet, leaving the rendered fat in the skillet.
 #. Drain juice from clams into the skillet with the onions, celery, potatoes and carrots. Add water to cover, and cook over medium heat until tender.                            
 #. Meanwhile, in a large, heavy saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Whisk in flour until smooth. Whisk in cream and stir constantly until thick and smooth. Stir in vegetables and clam juice. Heat through, but do not boil.                            
 #. Stir in clams just before serving. If they cook too much they get tough. When clams are heated through, stir in vinegar, and season with salt and pepper.                            

Serves: Original recipe yields 8 servings
