Chicken Stir Fry 2
==================

Notes
-----
* I saw that we already had an entry for chicken stir fry but thought that this
  was different enough (and good enough :D) to add another entry.
* I made this for a dinner party we had here and a lot of my friends loved it.
* Haven't done it for meal prep yet, but I'd imagine it would go well.
* Splurge on the seasame oil (or "borrow" some from a friend ;) ). The
  fragrance/taste is v good.
* The author of this recipie looks to make her own content so I'm liking her
 `here <www.eatyourselfskinny.com/one-skillet-cashew-chicken-stir-fry>` as well
  at the bottom of the page.
* The sauce is seriously amazing.
* I had never gotten ginger before and it def add a lot of flavor to the dish.
  Buy real ginger and grate it up (it doesn't take that long) and don't use the
  pre grated ginger that comes in a bottle.
* I used garlic from a jar. I hate chopping garlic.
* Def don't skip out on the cashews. They add a lot.

Ingredients (Sauce)
-----------
* 4 tbsp soy sauce (I used low sodium; you don't have to)
* 3 tbsp peanut butter
* 2 tbsp honey
* 1 tsp of seasame oil (see my note above)
* 1 tbsp of ginger (see note above)
* 2-3 tbps of water (to make sauce to consistency)

Ingredients (Stirfry)
-----------
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 1 pound of chicken cut into 1 inch pieces
* 3 cloves of garlic
* 2 cups of broccoli floretts
* 1 red bell pepper cut into narrow strips
* 1 cup sugar snap peas (we didn't use these SINCE SMITH'S IS ALWAYS OUT OF
  THEM) and the dish turned out fine!
* 1/2 cup of carrots cut into smaller carrots
* 1/3 cup of unsalted cashews
* 4 green onions chopped.
* Some mushrooms (chopped) I added these because I love mushrooms.

Ingredients (Rice)
-----------
* Rice


Instructions
------------

#. Begin cooking your rice.
#. Whisk together all of your sauce stuff and set aside. Add however much water
   you want to the sauce to get things to the consistency you want. This is
   about to smell amazing.
#. In skillet (sized appropriately for about the food you're going to make)
   drizzle olive oil into pan and then saute chicken. Season with salt and pepper
   if you want. Cook chicken through.
#. Add garlic to pan and saute for half a minute.
#. Add your veggies (broccoli, red pepper, snap peas, carrots, mushrooms) to the
   dish and continue to cook until veggies are tender (about 5 mins).
#. Add cashews and green onions and sauce and cook for another minute.
#. Hopefully your rice is done by now.
#. Serve.

Serves: at least 1
