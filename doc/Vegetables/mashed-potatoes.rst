Mashed Potatoes
==================

Ingredients
-----------

* A bag of potatoes (We use about a 10 pound bag for holidays with family)
* Like half a tub of sour cream
* 1 package of cream cheese
* garlic salt to taste

Instructions
------------

#. Peel the potatoes
#. Cut the potatoes into even 3/4 inch cubes (it's important they're p consistnent for cooking purposes)
#. Boil the potatoes in a large pot until they're soft (a fork can pierce through them with little effort)
#. Drain water (but don't rinse)
#. In one of those cool mixer things, *slowly* add the potatoes, cream cheese, and sour cream in
#. Once things are thoroughly mashed, add garlic salt to taste

Serves:

Notes
-----
* The exact amount of ingredients might not be right. This is all I have from memory :D I remember it being something around that though.
* This is best made a day in advance (it allows time for the flavors to meld together)
* Though, if you make it the day before you need to hide the potatoes well from vultures. Otherwise, somehow, the potatoes slowly go missing.
* If you make too many, lol, potatoes, you might need to put things through the mixer in batches.
* Or you can mash things by hand.
