Cream Chickpeas
==================


Ingredients
-----------

* 2 tbps of olive oil (or butter)
* ~1 tbsp of tomato paste
* 1 can of rinsed chickpeas
* Spices to taste (paprika, cumin, garlic salt, whatever)
* 1 cup of heavy cream

Instructions
------------

#. Warm olive oil in pan.
#. Add chickpeas, tomato paste, and spices. Cook until chickpeas are coated in paste.
#. Add heavy cream and bring to simmer.
#. Add egg and cook until egg white is cooked (don't necessarily need to cook the yolk).
#. Plate and eat.

Servings: 2

Notes
-----
* V good (tomato and spices do a lot).
* Easy to make (takes ~10 mins) for you lazy college students :).
* High in protein (eggs, chickpeas)
* For a healthier dish you could use milk or half and half instead of cream. I intend to try this but I haven't yet.
