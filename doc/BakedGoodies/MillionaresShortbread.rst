===============

Ingredients
-----------

Shortbread:
 * 1/4 cup brown sugar
 * 1 tsp vanilla extract
 * 1 tsp kosher salt
 * 1/2 cup melted unsalted butter
 * ~1 cup flour

Carmel:
 * 1/4 cup unsalted butter
 * 7oz sweetend condensed milk
 * 1/2 cup brown sugar
 * 1/4 cup corn syrup
 * 1/4 cup heavy cream
 * 1/2 tsp kosher salt

 Rest:
  * 4oz dark chocolate

Instructions
-------------

Shortbread:
 #. Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
 #. For the shortbread, combine brown sugar, vanilla, salt, and butter in large bowl.
 #. Mix in flour, until dough is crumbly but sticks together if pressed.
 #. Butter (or tinfoil) the inside of an 8x8 baking pan and push the shortbread into the bottom of the pan. Flatten the top with a spatula, and stab all over with a fork.
 #. Bake the shortbread for 15 - 20min, until edges begin to turn golden brown.
 #. Let the shortbread cool for at least an hour before adding toppings.

Carmel:
 #. Add all ingredients to a large pot. Put on the stove over medium heat, and whisk together.
 #. Simmer the mixture, while whisking frequently, until the mixture reaches 236F - 240F (15 - 20min).
 #. Pour mixture over the shortbread, tap pan to pop any bubbles, and allow to cool.

Tempered Chocolate:
 #. Chop 1oz of chocolate and set aside.
 #. Melt the remaining chocolate in a bowl over boiling water, never allowing it to get warmer than 120F.
 #. Remove the chocolate from the heat, and stir in the chocolate we set aside earlier. Allow to cool to 82F.
 #. Rewarm the melted chocolate to 88F, and pour over cooled carmel. Tap to remove any bubbles, and cool in the fridge for at least 10 minutes.
 #. Cut into 16 equal bars and serve.


Serves: Original recipe yields 16 bars

Notes
-----
 * The carmel mixture will seem to stall out at around 225F. Just keep whisking and it will eventually make it to 236F.
 * Test your chocolate temper on a sheet of wax paper to ensure you did it properly. If not, you can go back to step 2 and redo it without wasting chocolate.
