Recipys
=======

Welcome to *Recipys*, the project of two CS students and friends
who enjoy cooking!

This project is `on github <https://github.com/bocajnotnef/Recipys>`__
and is hosted by `readthedocs.org <https://readthedocs.org/>`__.

If you have suggestions for a recipie and are familiar with git,
use the template to get started.

If you are unfamiliar with git, feel free to open an issue on the
`issue tracker <https://github.com/bocajnotnef/Recipys/issues>`__ with
the details of the recipe and one of us will add it to the repo.

Also feel free to make note of any typographical errors, dead links or suggestions
for existing recipes!

Enjoy!
